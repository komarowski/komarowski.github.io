<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Charyn Canyon is located 200 km east of Almaty, close to the border with China. During this way, the landscape changes from the green city to the steppe and semi-desert.</p>
<p>The main attraction of the canyon is the &quot;Valley of Castles&quot;, which stretches for 2 km, and the height of the rocks in this area is 370 meters. The canyon stretches along the Charyn River with clear turquoise water.</p>
<p>Definitely worth a visit at least once.</p>
