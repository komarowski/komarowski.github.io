<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Botanical Garden is a specially protected natural area with a unique collection of many thousands of flora of Kazakhstan, Europe, the Caucasus, North America and East Asia.</p>
<p>In my opinion the best months to visit are April, May and June. The time when the local flora blooms and also the best weather in Almaty (not so hot and there are occasional rains).</p>
