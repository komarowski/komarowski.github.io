<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The 3163 meters high Talgar pass is a popular holiday destination all year round. At the foot of the pass is Shymbulak ski resort. A branch of the cable car was laid to the saddle of the pass, so anyone could enjoy the views of the glaciers of the Trans-Ili Alatau.</p>
<p>Nearby is the peak of Shymbulachka with a height of 3450 meters. I think this is the easiest peak in its category to climb, since most of the way can be covered by cable car to the pass.</p>
<p>The Talga pass is also a convenient place to start for conquering the four-thousanders.</p>
